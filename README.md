# **AI Legal Advisor - Intellectual Property & POSH Law**

**AI Legal Advisor** is an AI-powered application designed to provide legal assistance focused solely on **Intellectual Property (IP)** law and **POSH (Prevention of Sexual Harassment)** law. This application leverages local **Large Language Models (LLMs)**, ensuring enhanced **data security** and **privacy** by processing all data on the user's local machine.

This project utilizes the **Microsoft Semantic Kernel** for building the AI agent and integrates **Phi3** for additional data privacy and security. The AI agent restricts the scope of queries to IP and POSH law, and **politely rejects** any questions outside these topics.

## **Project Overview**

This application allows users to interact with an AI agent that specializes in answering legal questions about **Intellectual Property** and **POSH law**. The AI agent is designed to:
- **Answer only** questions related to **Intellectual Property** and **POSH Law**.
- **Politely reject** any unrelated queries with a message indicating the scope of expertise.
- Run **locally on the user's machine**, ensuring that data privacy is maintained.

The solution leverages **local LLMs**, providing better **security** and **data privacy** compared to cloud-based services. However, please note that the system’s performance is dependent on the machine’s hardware.

---

## **Features**

- **AI Agent with Restricted Domain**: The AI agent answers only questions related to **Intellectual Property** and **POSH law**, rejecting anything outside of those domains.
- **Local LLMs**: Data is processed **locally**, enhancing **privacy** and **security**.
- **Data Security**: Uses **Phi3** to ensure that all data is securely processed and stored.
- **Flexible Performance**: The system can be optimized for **high-end machines** for better performance. However, performance might be slower on **low-spec hardware**.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Provides a clean, easy-to-use interface for legal professionals or anyone seeking legal advice.

---

## **Technology Stack**

- **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**: For building the conversational AI.
- **Phi3**: For local data processing and **enhanced privacy**.
- **Local LLMs**: Ensures all data remains on the user's local machine for improved **data security**.
- **.NET MAUI / Blazor**: Used for building the cross-platform interface and backend logic.
- **C# / ASP.NET Core**: Backend programming language for AI and communication services.
- **Ollama / GPT-4 (local models)**: Local models used to generate responses.

---

## **Installation**

Follow these steps to get the AI Legal Advisor up and running on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet) (required for building the application)
- [Phi3](https://phi3.com/) for data privacy and local processing.
- A **local LLM** instance (e.g., **Ollama** or **GPT-4**), running on your machine for AI responses.

### **Steps to Install**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Vikas-Makhija/LegalAdvisor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Navigate to the project directory and install the required packages:
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebAssembly" Version="8.0.10" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Controls" Version="$(MauiVersion)" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Compatibility" Version="$(MauiVersion)" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.AspNetCore.Components.WebView.Maui" Version="$(MauiVersion)" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.Debug" Version="8.0.0" />
<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.SemanticKernel" Version="1.29.0" />
<PackageReference Include="OllamaSharp" Version="4.0.7" />

3. **Configure Local LLM**:
   - If you're using **phi3**, ensure it’s running on your machine and is accessible at the specified URL (`http://localhost:11434`).


4. **Set Up Phi3**:
   - Follow Phi3’s [installation guide](https://phi3.com/setup) to ensure your environment is properly configured for local data security.

5. **Run the Application**:
   To run the application, use the following command:
   ```bash
   dotnet run
   ```

## **Usage**

1. **Start the Application**:
   After running the application, open your browser and go to `http://localhost:5000` (or the port specified in your configuration).
   
2. **Ask Legal Questions**:
   - You can now start asking questions about **Intellectual Property** or **POSH law**. 
   - If you ask a question outside of these domains, the AI will **politely reject** the query, explaining that it can only answer questions within those two areas.

3. **Select the Local LLM**:
   - The dropdown menu allows you to choose between different local models, such as **Ollama** or **GPT-4**.
   
4. **View Responses**:
   - The AI will respond in a **chat format**, providing insights or answers to your legal questions.
